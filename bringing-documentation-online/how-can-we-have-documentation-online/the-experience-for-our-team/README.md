# The experience for our team

**We will have to use a platform like this one, Gitbook**. It is based on a language called **markdwon**, but I won't bore you with the technical details about this. \
\
For the n00bs out there like me: if you want to know more about markdown, you can read this article:

### What do you really need to know about markdown?

1. It's based on simple text. In essence, we just have to write like if we would in a normal Word doc.&#x20;
2. It can be easily converted from and into other text based files like docx, pdf, html, and many more.
3. It can seamlessly be translated into the final output in an editor like this. This is the editor view I'm seeing while I'm editing the text right now (mine is in dark mode):

### What more can I do with Gitbook?

It's a great tool, you can easily format content to add anything you need: text, different headings, lists, tables, images, embed other websites (like iframes), link whenever you want, personalize text with different formats and colors, easily create pages and subpages and strucuture your content. The result is always a pre-defined UI (personalized by us), so it will always look balanced and clean.

You can also hide specific pages, and create pages that are only accessible through private links.

On the editing view, we can also leave comments and annotations, and have different roles, where some people can suggest updates, but only a select view can approve them to go live.
