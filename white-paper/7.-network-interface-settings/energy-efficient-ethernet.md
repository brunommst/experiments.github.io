# Energy Efficient Ethernet

When enabled, this allows the adapter to engage power-saving features while keeping connections active. This technology uses the standard IEEE 802.3az to allow for less power during periods of low data activity. Adapters that utilize the IEEE 802.3az standard should have no impact on the performance of NDI; however, some integrated circuits exist that were developed before the standard was finalized or do not adhere to the standard at all. In these cases, it is best to disable the energy efficiency while determining the best network optimization.
