# The value of NDI

### The current limitations to connectivity <a href="#the-current-limitations" id="the-current-limitations"></a>

When we think about video connectivity, it’s natural to consider the ever-expanding possibilities, more options, and unlimited potential.

But the fact is that, as with all technology-driven revolutions, the existing way of doing things still presents more limitations than we would like:

*   **Dependency on equipment and budget**

    Currently, the number and quality of connections are very dependent on cost, available cables, infrastructure, and bandwidth.
* **Complexity and need for specialized expertise**\
  Most connectivity solutions require networking expertise to set up and troubleshoot. They struggle to provide a simple, user-friendly experience.
* **Too many working connectivity protocols**\
  There can be many protocols in the same workflow, requiring a lot of conversion and understanding of different technologies. Alternatively, some products only operate in closed ecosystems, which reduces overall interoperability.

### NDI is removing the limits to video connectivity.

*   **High efficiency**

    We develop the most advanced video connectivity formats; and allow productions to scale without scaling costs.
*   **Plug & play**

    We guarantee that any NDI-enabled product is easy to operate, even without networking knowledge, and always works seamlessly.
*   **Interoperability**

    We unlock complete connectivity with a growing ecosystem of NDI-enabled and compatible devices, making NDI the only protocol you’ll need to connect with multiple products, device types, and brand ecosystems.

For these reasons and many more, NDI enables transitioning to an incredibly versatile IP video pipeline without negating existing investments in SDI and HDMI cameras and infrastructure or costly new high-speed network infrastructures.
