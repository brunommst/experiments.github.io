# CPU Requirements

### CPU Requirements

NDIÂ® Lib is heavily optimized (much of it is written in assembly). While it detects available architecture and uses the best path it can, the minimum required SIMD level is SSSE3 (introduced by Intel in 2005). The NDI library running on ARM platforms requires NEON support. To the degree possible, hardware acceleration of streams uses GPU-based fixed function pipelines for decompression and is supported on Windows, macOS, iOS, tvOS platforms; all GPUs on these platforms are supported with special case optimized support for Intel QuickSync and nVidia. However, this is not required, and we will always fall back to software-based compression and decompression.
