# 12. NDI in Cloud

Setting up an NDI-based video production in a Virtual Private Cloud is quite easy; the first step is to define how to make NDI Discovery and Registration work in a VPC. Cloud providers allow the creation of a multicast domain; multicast is required to use mDNS-based discovery and registration. This setup requires the creation of a transit gateway with multicast enabled. Enabling multicast in the cloud might require specific knowledge; for this reason, the easiest solution to enable NDI Discovery and registration is to set up a Discovery Service. NDI Discovery Service requires just a basic Windows or Linux-based instance to run.
