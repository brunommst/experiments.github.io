# What's the catch?

There are no perfect solutions. I'm sure you'll be able to find some downsides to Gitbook, and we have already identified a couple:

* The version we need is paid. The budget is something to be discussed, although me and Bruno are confident that it will end up being much, much cheaper than developing and implmentation time for third-party services.
* This platform has a lot of integrations, and we still need to dive deeper into all of them (Google Analytics is available, figma for design stuff, etc.) but _as far as we can tell_ at the moment, Pardot is not one of them.

In the end, we believe that the **PROS** far outweigh the **cons**. Here are a few of them:

* easy to edit, update, maintain and navigate platform
* easy to adapt to our current documentation worflow, with minor changes
* after a quick migration phase, everyhting can be done centrally on the platform itself in terms of creating new documentation
* is useful for the whole NDI team
* saves up money and implementation time from third party
* builds up legitimacy for our tech
* allows to quickly and easily create more educational content / guides
* allows personalization of look and feel, personalized tiers of access and many more.
