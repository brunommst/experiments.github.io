# Introduction

This documentation is paramount for developers and integrators seeking to consistently embed the full potential of NDI technology into their products.&#x20;

This comprehensive guide aims to provide a clear roadmap to understanding and implementing NDI within your applications, systems, and workflows. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to NDI, it will empower you to seamlessly leverage the capabilities of NDI, enabling your products to seamlessly connect with other NDI-enabled products and transmit high-quality, low-latency video and audio over IP networks.&#x20;

From setup and configuration to advanced usage scenarios, this SDK documentation is your go-to resource to unlock our connectivity tech, facilitating innovation and efficiency across a broad spectrum of applications.

This documentation is continuously updated to match the most recent version of our Core Technology. Currently, we are offering **NDI 5.6**. You can check the most meaningful updates in our [change log](sdk-changes.md).
