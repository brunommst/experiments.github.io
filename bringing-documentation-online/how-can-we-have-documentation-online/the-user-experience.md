# The user experience

So, what will this documentation section look like to a user navigating our website? How can it be found?

### 1

Well, from an information architecture perspective, this section would be under the **resources** section in our main menu, as illustrated below:

Many links to specific pages within Docs and Guides could also be found within multiple sections of the website (e.g. a CTA after we talk about High Bandwidth stating _"Learn more about the technical details of NDI High Bandwidth"_)

### 2

After that, users will be lead into a page within a subdomain - docs.ndi.video - that present a look & feel very much like the one you are right now navigating on. Branded with our colors, easy to use, clean and providing clear and detailed information, images, links, and whatever is needed.

### 3

It is important to note that some of this information would be limited to specific users (a common case would be providing documentation on an unreleased build to some testers on the NDI Beta program). In that case, these users will be able to access these documentation pages through special links, provided on their user dahsboard. For all other users, while the a page might exist, it will just say something like:&#x20;

> "This information is restricted to **NDI Beta participants**. If you already are part of NDI Beta, you can access the information in your profile dashboard. If you'd like to become part of NDI Beta, click the link. \
