# Why should we have documentation online?

There is a multitude of reasons for doing so. After all, the biggest tech companies in the world are not doing it just to have extra leg work. But here are some:

* We have more control and curation over the information on our own technology and initiatives **vs** e.g. someone searching _"NDI SDK docs"_ on Google and finding random info that is not approved by us:&#x20;

* On an **internal processes level**, we can have a single centralized place where all documentation will always be updated, can be easily found, and also easy to update. Platforms like this, called [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), are very easy to work on and edit, like a simple text file. **PLUS** whenever thereâ€™s an update, we can easily export the file we need into a PDF file and bring it to our SDK folders - which means _**no duplicate work**_ :dancer::dancer:.\

* A documentation section on our website would be used to contain not only technical docs about the SDKs or Tools, but also best practices guides, educational content, guidelines for marketing, co-branding but also certification programs, additional info about initiatives like NDI Beta. In short, any more detailed information or knowledge that doesn't belong on the first layer of our website.\

  This makes it a very useful tool for basically <mark style="color:purple;">**any team within NDI**</mark>.\

* If done correctly, it will r**emove a lot of work from support** - which the team can use to focus on more valuable tasks for the company, like pushing certification. In fact, a lot of research is pointing out that users and customers, in general, prefer to find clear information by themselves than having to go through a cumbersome process of support tickets. So, it's a win-win situation for support.\

* Today, it is not only expected from modern tech companies to have documentation of various depths online. This not only help more directly on SEO, but most prosumers nowadays (and especially our targets) also like to probe around and understand the technology before having to actually download things. And if they understand what we are offering makes sense to them, they **instantly become more qualified leads** if they contact us to know more.

### Now that we hopefully understand WHY having documentation online is essential, we can move into the [HOW](bringing-documentation-online/how-can-we-have-documentation-online/).
