# What is NDI?

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ndilogo.gif" alt="NDI logo animation"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**NDI** stands for **Network Device Interface**. It is a widely adopted video connectivity standard based on proprietary IP networking specifications.\
\
NDI enables multimedia systems to identify and communicate with one another over IP and to encode, transmit, and receive many streams of high-quality, low latency, frame-accurate video and audio, and exchange metadata in real-time.

NDI operates [bi-directionally](../wip-glossary.md), with many streams on a shared connection. Its encoding algorithm is resolution and frame-rate-independent, supporting 4K resolutions and beyond, along with unlimited floating-point audio channels and custom metadata.\
\
NDI can be integrated and/or supported by any network-connected product, including video cameras, graphics systems, video mixers, capture cards, multimedia players, video editing applications, and many other devices and software.\
\
NDI _is not_ a codec. NDI supports many different video codecs, like our proprietary SpeedHQ, found on the NDI High Bandwidth format, [AVC (H.264)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced\_Video\_Coding) and [HEVC (H.265)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High\_Efficiency\_Video\_Coding), found on the NDI HX formats. Different NDI formats correspond to specifications related to codecs supported, bandwidth spending, glass-to-glass latency, and image quality.
