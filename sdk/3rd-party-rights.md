# 19. 3rd Party Rights

The NDI libraries make minor use of other third-party libraries, for which we are very grateful to the authors. If you are distributing NDI DLLs yourself, it is important that your distribution is compliant with the licenses for these third-party libraries. For the sake of convenience, we have combined these licenses within a single file that you should include, `Processing.NDI.Lib.Licenses.txt`, which is included beside the NDI binary files.
