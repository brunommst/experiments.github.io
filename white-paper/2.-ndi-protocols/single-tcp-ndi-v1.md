# Single TCP â€“ NDI v1

This network communications protocol enables two host systems to establish a connection, exchange data packets, and ensure data is delivered intact to the correct destination. TCP is typically grouped with IP (Internet Protocol) and is collectively known as TCP/IP.

Single-TCP is supported on all NDI versions. While the other transmission modes are likely to perform better, **this mode offers baseline compatibility for all NDI clients**.
