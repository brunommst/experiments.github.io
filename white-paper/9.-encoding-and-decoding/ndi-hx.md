# NDI HX

NDI is available in some devices and applications using a different compression codec than NDI High Bandwidth. This format is known as NDI HX. Devices using this NDI format will be labeled with the HX moniker. HX offers similar video quality at a much lower bit rate, which can be useful in contexts with limited bandwidth, like Fast Ethernet networks, Wi-Fi, or WAN connections.

NDI HX is commonly found in hardware devices, like PTZ cameras and mobile phones, but it is possible to have NDI HX in software applications as well. Software applications using NDI HX will leverage the GPU on the computer for enhanced encoding performance. For this reason, having a good GPU on the system is an advantage.

**There are two variations of NDI HX: NDI HX and NDI HX3**; both can be decoded by software applications thanks to the codec provided by the NDI Tools.
